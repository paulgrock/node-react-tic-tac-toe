For the coding challenge, we'd like you to write a tic-tac-toe game that allows us to play against a computer. It doesn't have to be perfect, but we expect not to win (so the computer always wins or ties). The player should be able to make the first move. Ideally we get a link to play and a way to see the source code when it's working. It can be in any language and there is no timeframe, since we understand this requires time that you have to fit in.

It can be submitted via:
Zip file
Tarball
Source files
Github
In browser (for JavaScript)
Link to Play (for WebDev)
XCode Project (for iOS)
.apk plus source files (for Android)
Looking forward to what you come up with!
